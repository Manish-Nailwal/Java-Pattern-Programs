# Java Pattern Programs

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that generate various output patterns using **loops and nested loops**. It’s part of my learning journey to strengthen problem-solving skills and understand Java control structures better.

- Hollow Rectangle
- Inverted Rotated Half Pyramid
- Inverted Half Pyramid
- Floyd’s Triangle
- Binary Triangle
- Butterfly Pattern
- Solid Rhombus
- Hollow Rhombus
- Diamond Pattern
- Number Pyramid
- Palindromic Pattern
